                    <p>
                    IT"S MY LIFE is a thought-provoking three-screen school assembly program that focuses on the desire for control;
                    our quest for independence; respect; and the power to choose what we feel is best for our lives. Students will
                    learn that the power to choose requires a heavy dose of personal responsibility, and that making the responsible
                    choice isn't always the easy choice.  
                    <br /><br />
                    There's a lot of pressure out there to make poor choices with consequences we may not like. Bullying, drugs, alcohol
                    and smoking are just a few of the irresponsible choices students will be tempted with along the way. By learning
                    how to manage our time correctly, and by discovering and pursuing the skills we enjoy, we can avoid those pressures
                    that hold us back from moving forward with our livess. With practice, we can develop the skills necessary to make
                    the right choices and act responsibly when facing difficult situations.
                    <br /><br />
                    Camfel Productions' IT'S MY LIFE is a motivational school assembly that will challenge your students to make the positive choices
                    for themselves, while they demonstrate respect for those around them.
