                        Spreading Kindness is Camfel Productions newest three-screen elementary program. It will challenge students to make being kind a priority for their lives. 
                        your students will discover that one small act of kindness, an encouraging word or a smile can change someone's attitude for the entire day.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        "Kindness is a language wheich the deaf can hear and the blind can see."  Mark Twain
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Spreading Kindness will motivate students to encourage others, smile more, judge less, and be considerate of others. Additionally, kindness
                        includes being kind to yourself with your own thoughts and ideas. Your students will be inspired to speak positively about themselves, 
                        their talents and abilities. They'll find that bullying and being critical are not the best way to make friends or to be the kind of person
                        they wish to be.
                        <br />

                        Spreading Kindness involves helping, sharing, listening, and teaching. if we do those things we can change both how 
                        you are perceived and how you see yourself. We like to be around those who are kind. it strangthens our social relationships and impacts the lives of others.
                        By working together to spread kindness we can improve our lives and inspire those around us to excell and achieve success. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Camfel Productions' Spreading Kindness is a high energy three-screen multi-media presentation designed to challenge students to become better
                        citizens and students. This experience of music and media focuses on the attitudes that 
                        lead to build up cliques, tear down confidence, and bullying behaviors. It's an invitation to look beneath the surface and see 
                        other people and ourselves. It will inspire your students to seek for opportunities to spread kindness.
