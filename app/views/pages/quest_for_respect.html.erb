        <h2> Theme: Respect</h2>
        <br/>
        
          <p >Everyone wants to be accepted, to be loved, to be respected. 
          Unfortunately, we often base our worth by the number of likes we get on Facebook 
          or by how many positive comments we receive after posting our latest "selfie." 
          Somehow we think the more exposed we are, the more admired we are, but in reality all we are is...well...more exposed.<br/><br/>
 
            Quest For Respect will examine our willingness to compromise our values in an attempt to find a place to fit in,
            and explore our rationale for getting involved in the use of drugs & alcohol, or aligning ourselves with bullies
            in order to find acceptance.<br/><br/>
 
            Quest For Respect will demonstrate that true respect is a by-product of how we live our lives each day, 
            how we react to crisis, and how we treat others and ourselves.<br/><br/>
 
            The pursuit of respect is a lifelong journey, sustained and proven by our actions every day.
