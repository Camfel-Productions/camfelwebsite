                    <br />
                    <p >     COUNT ON ME focuses on what it takes to be someone others can rely on. Those we can trust follow
                        through on what they say and do. We can count on those who demonstrate responsibility by doing their
                        chores on time, getting their homework done, and being there fur us. We desire to be around those
                        whom we can count on to help us through a difficult time and those who will stand with us whe we
                        see or encounter a bullying situtation. 
                        
                             There's a lot  of pressure out there to make poor choices. Bullying, playing games, or just being
                        social are a few of the distractions that your students will be tempted with along the way. Learning
                        how to manage these pressures, their time, and developing positive social skills and awareness
                        can be challenging. But they can, with practice, develop and begin making the right choices and act
                        act responsibly when facing a difficult situation.
