                <strong>POINT OF VIEW!</strong> is a new 40 minute multi-media experience from Camfel Productions designed to look beyond 
                the violence, racism, intolerance, harrassment, and hate in this world, giving students a new perspective 
                on the differences that separate them from their peers, their parents, and the others who are around them. 
                While they gain a new sense of their own innate worth, they'll grow to appreciate 
                the diversity of race, language, and culture that make up the community in which they live.

                <strong>IT'S MY LIFE</strong> is a three-screen school assembly. The program focuses on the desire for control; for independence;
                respect; and the power to choose. However, the power to choose comes when we make responsible choices. Making the 
                responsible choice isn't always the easy choice. Everyone likes to have fun, but too often the fun choices are in direct
                conflict with the responsible ones. IT'S MY LIFE is a motivational school assembly challenging students to make positive
                choices for themsleves while demonstrating respect for those around them.
